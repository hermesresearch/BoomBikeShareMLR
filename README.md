# #################### Multiple Linear Regression For BoomBike Share

Building a multiple linear regression model to predict the demand for shared bikes for a US bike-sharing provider, BoomBikes. The data used in this project consists of daily bike demands based on various factors like weather, season, and other variables.

Data Overview

The dataset has a mix of categorical and numerical variables. Some of the variables like 'weathersit' and 'season' have values as 1, 2, 3, 4, which are not ordered, but rather represent categorical values. Therefore, it is essential to convert these feature values into categorical string values before proceeding with model building.

The 'yr' column has two values, 0 and 1, representing the years 2018 and 2019, respectively. Although it might seem like dropping this column is a good idea, it is essential to consider that these bike-sharing systems are gaining popularity, and the demand for these bikes is increasing every year. Therefore, the 'yr' column might be a useful variable for prediction.

The target variable for this project is the 'cnt' variable, which indicates the total number of bike rentals, including both casual and registered users.

Multiple linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and multiple independent variables. In this project, we will use multiple linear regression to predict the demand for shared bikes based on various factors like weather, season, and other variables.

To build our model, we will first preprocess the data by converting categorical variables to numerical values and scaling the numerical variables. We will then split the data into training and testing sets and fit the model to the training data. We will evaluate the model's performance using various metrics like the mean squared error and the R-squared value.

We will also perform feature selection to identify the most important variables for our model. This will help us to build a more accurate and efficient model by removing any unnecessary variables.

Overall, the multiple linear regression model for BoomBike Share aims to accurately predict the demand for shared bikes based on various factors, which can help the company make informed decisions about bike inventory and marketing strategies.

* ############# Conclusions ############

In conclusion, this project aimed to build a multiple linear regression model to predict the demand for shared bikes for BoomBike Share based on various factors such as weather, season, and other variables. The project utilized technologies such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, and Statsmodels to preprocess the data, perform feature selection, and build and evaluate the model.

The LR_5 model performance metrics showed that the demand for bikes is significantly affected by several predictor variables, including year, holiday, temperature, wind speed, September, Foggy, Rain/Snowing, Summer, and Winter. The model demonstrated a good fit, with an R-squared value of 0.836 for the training dataset and 0.7965 for the testing dataset.

The results of the project can provide valuable insights to BoomBike Share to improve its inventory and marketing strategies to attract more customers during peak demand periods. Based on the analysis, it is recommended that BoomBike focuses its marketing efforts on non-holiday days with moderate weather conditions during summer and fall months. It is also suggested that the pricing strategy be adjusted to reflect these trends and to optimize overall marketing efforts.

## Conclusions ####

In conclusion, the LR_5 multiple linear regression model for BoomBike Share shows a good fit with a high R-squared value for the training dataset and an acceptable R-squared value for the testing dataset. The model's performance metrics suggest that demand for shared bikes is significantly influenced by several predictor variables, including year, holiday, temperature, wind speed, September, Foggy, Rain/Snowing, Summer, and Winter.

Based on the coefficients of the predictor variables, it can be concluded that temperature has the highest positive effect on bike demand, followed by year, Winter, and September. In contrast, Rain/Snowing has the most significant negative effect on bike demand, followed by windspeed, holiday, and Foggy.

Overall, these insights can be valuable for BoomBike Share to improve its inventory and marketing strategies to attract more customers during peak demand periods.
